Made a web application using node.js. The app displays some basic information about myself using HTML but node is used to start the server required to run it on the web.

 In order to run the app, you must have the following installed:
 A code editor such as Visual Studio Code or anything like that,
 node.js and npm

Ensure node.js is installed, for npm it should automatically install by itself, you won't have to install it separately.

technologies used:
http
javascript
node.js
npm
